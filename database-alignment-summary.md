# Database Alignment Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Database Structure Documentation
- Created `database-structure.md` with comprehensive SQL schema
- Defined tables: players, games, game_expansions, game_characters, game_sessions, session_players
- Added views for calculated statistics
- Included indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Updated TypeScript Interfaces

#### App.tsx - Main Interfaces
- **Player Interface**: Added optional fields, proper date handling, email field
- **Game Interface**: Aligned all fields with database schema
- **GameExpansion Interface**: Added proper ID fields (expansion_id, bgg_expansion_id)
- **GameCharacter Interface**: Changed from `id` to `character_key` for consistency
- **Added new interfaces**: GameSession, SessionPlayer for future session tracking

#### GamesPage.tsx - Component Interfaces
- **Character Interface**: Updated to use `character_key` instead of `id`
- **Expansion Interface**: Updated to use `expansion_id` and `bgg_expansion_id`

### 3. Updated BGG API Service
- **BGGExpansion Interface**: Changed `id` to `bgg_expansion_id`
- **BGGCharacter Interface**: Changed `id` to `character_key`
- Updated expansion parsing to use new field structure
- Updated character generation to use new field structure

### 4. Updated Mock Data
- Aligned all mock data with new database structure
- Added proper timestamps and optional fields
- Updated expansion and character data format

### 5. Updated CRUD Operations
- **addPlayer**: Now includes all database fields with proper defaults
- **updatePlayer**: Includes `updated_at` timestamp
- **addGame**: Handles all database fields and relationships
- **updateGame**: Includes `updated_at` timestamp and proper field handling

### 6. Fixed UI Issues
- Updated textarea expansion display format
- Fixed year_published condition check (added null safety)
- Updated character display to use `character_key`

## Database Readiness

The application is now structured to support:
1. **Direct database mapping**: All fields align with SQL schema
2. **Session tracking**: Interfaces ready for game session recording
3. **Player statistics**: Calculated fields vs stored statistics separation
4. **BGG integration**: Proper handling of external API data
5. **Normalization**: Expansions and characters in separate related tables

## Migration Path

When moving to a database:
1. Use the provided SQL schema in `database-structure.md`
2. Update storage operations to use database queries instead of useKV
3. Implement views for calculated statistics (player win rates, etc.)
4. Add session tracking functionality for actual game results

All interfaces and data structures are now database-ready without requiring breaking changes to the UI components.
