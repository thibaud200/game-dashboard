## Database

The application uses SQLite as the primary database. The database structure is designed to handle:

- **Players** - User profiles and statistics
- **Games** - Board game information with BGG integration
- **Sessions** - Game session records and scoring
- **Characters** - Game character/role definitions
- **Expansions** - Game expansion tracking

### Quick Start

To initialize the database:

```bash
cd backend/database
./init_db.sh
```

This will create `boardgame.db` with the complete schema and sample data.
